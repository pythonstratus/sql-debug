**Subject:** Question: Timecode 750 and 760 Special Handling in Weekly Time Verification

Hi Samuel,

I'm working on modernizing the Weekly Time Verification (WTV) module and noticed some special handling for timecodes **750** and **760** in the legacy Pro*C code (`entity_common.pc`). I wanted to understand the business logic behind these:

**Timecode 750:**
In the `getTimeVerifyData` function (group view), timecode 750 is explicitly **excluded** from the Report Days (DAYS) count:
```sql
timenon.timecode ^= '750'
```

**Timecode 760:**
In the `getTimeVerifyNonData` function (non-case time detail), timecode 760 has special binary handling:
```sql
decode(hours, 0, 1, 0)  -- Returns 1 if hours=0, otherwise 0
```
This differs from all other timecodes which simply sum hours.

**Questions:**
1. What do timecodes 750 and 760 represent?
2. Is there a business reason for excluding 750 from the day count?
3. Why does 760 use a presence indicator (1/0) instead of actual hours?

I want to ensure we preserve the correct business logic in the new system. Any documentation or context you can share would be helpful.

Thanks,
Santosh
